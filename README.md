# OpenCart Manual Testing Project

## About This Project
This project showcases my **manual testing skills** by testing the OpenCart demo website.  
It includes detailed test cases for key functionalities and a **sample bug report** to demonstrate how bugs are documented professionally.  

**Website Tested:** [OpenCart Demo](https://demo.opencart.com/)

## Files in This Repository
- **OpenCart_Test_Cases.xlsx** – Contains 20 test cases covering login, search, add to cart, checkout, account management, and more.  
- **OpenCart_Bug_Report.xlsx** – Sample bug report showing how to log and track bugs.  
  > **Note:** The OpenCart demo website is stable, so no actual bugs were found. This bug report is for demonstration purposes only.

## How to Use
1. Download the Excel files from this repository.  
2. Execute the test cases on the OpenCart demo website.  
3. Observe results and update the bug report if you want to practice documenting bugs.

## Highlights
- All test cases are **original and created by me**.  
- The bug report demonstrates **how to document issues professionally**, even when no real bugs are present.  
- Project shows **end-to-end testing process** for an e-commerce website.
